# 🚀 My Script Collection

Welcome to my personal script collection! This is where I share the cool tools and scripts I create as I explore AI prompting, programming, and other interesting things I learn along the way.

## 🎯 What's Inside

This repository is a growing collection of scripts in various programming languages that I find helpful in my daily life and learning journey. From productivity tools to AI experiments, you'll find a bit of everything here!

### Current Scripts

#### 🐍 Python
- **Focus Timer** - A fun, colorful terminal-based timer that helps you stay focused with encouraging messages and app usage tracking. Perfect for Pomodoro sessions!

### Coming Soon
- C++ scripts from my coursework
- More AI prompting experiments
- Other helpful utilities

## 🎮 How to Use

Each script has its own README with detailed instructions. For example, to use the Focus Timer:

```bash
# Run a 25-minute focus session
python python/timer.py 25m

# View your focus history
python python/timer.py --report

# See today's focus stats
python python/timer.py --today
```

## 🤓 Why I Created This

I created this repository to:
- Share useful scripts with the world
- Document my learning journey
- Explore different programming languages and techniques
- Have fun with coding!

## 📚 Learning Together

Feel free to use, modify, or contribute to any of these scripts. I'm always learning and improving, so your feedback and suggestions are welcome!
